# European Star game

## Coding languages

I will use TypeScript in this project. I also know Java and Python well enough to review other students' projects made with them.

## Data sctructures and algorithms

On an abstract level, the data structure will be an undirected graph. This will represent the game's map. The graph's vertices represent spots on the map. This graph can contain loops.

The graph will likely be implemented with an array that contains spot objects. The spot object contains an edge array that stores ids. The ids reference the spots that are directly linked to the spot.

I haven't yet decided what algorithms would be the best for this. This will be updated.

## Problem

The goal is to make a virtual version of a game inspired by African Star that is changed to European star for creative purposes. The game contains a quite complicated map with many different paths, and the main problem is to find all the possible paths from point A to B with a certain number on the dice.

I chose the data sctructure mainly because it felt the most intuitive.

## Possible functions

### Can I get to point B from a point A?

A function that gets the map, the two spots and the dice roll number of 1-6 and returns a boolean telling whether the player can get to point B from A with the given dice roll number.

## Time and space requirements

The time and space requirements haven't been decided yet. Will be updated.

## Study programme

My study programme is Bachelor of Computer Science.

## Documentation languages

All my code and documents will be written in English.
